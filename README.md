# VSDS-LDESClient4J
Linked Data Event Streams replication+synchronization client for Java

> **Note**: this repo is not yet used.
> 
> Currently, the LDES client code is part of the [Informatievlaanderen/VSDS-LDESClient-NifiProcessor](https://github.com/Informatievlaanderen/VSDS-LDESClient-NifiProcessor) repository.
> 
> We intend to extract the LDES client as an SDK so it can be used as part of frameworks other than [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/).
